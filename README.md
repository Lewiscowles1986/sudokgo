# SudokGo

A high speed sudoku solver written in Go.
This rules based solver also describes the steps to solve to aid in learning.

(This includes a very slow generator that is a work in progress.)

## Usage - Solve

The solver takes the puzzle as a string input, a string of 81 characters
that are either the numbers 1-9 or a dash for a blank.

```
$ sudokgo solve -9-6-4---54-78-2-978--291-----9--8-3----6-------8---7---4--6-5---5247---1----8-2-

that is the difficulty to produce. The default difficulty (if omitted) is
moderate.

```
$ sudokgo generate simple
